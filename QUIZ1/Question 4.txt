Function Definition (find_Single_Number)

This function looks for a single unique number in an array
It takes two parameters nums (the array) and len (the length of the array)

Variables Initialization

int single_Number = -1 Initializes a variable to store the single number It starts with -1 as a placeholder

Nested Loop (Checking for Duplicates)

Two nested loops are used to compare each element of the array with every other element
If an element is found to be the same as another element at a different position it sets (has_Duplicate) to true and breaks out of the inner loop

Checking for No Duplicates

If (has_Duplicate) remains false after the inner loop it means the current element doesn't have any duplicates in the array
In that case the current element is considered the single number and it is stored in the single_Number variable The loop breaks 
The function returns the value of single_Number which is either the identified single number or -1 if no single 

Main Function

Initializes an array nums with values and calculates its length (len)
Calls the find_Single_Number function with the array and its length
Prints the result
